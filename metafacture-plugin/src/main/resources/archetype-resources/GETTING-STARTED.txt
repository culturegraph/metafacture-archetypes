GETTING STARTED

This is a Metafacture plugin project. Most things have already been configured 
for you but there are three TODOs in the `pom.xml` which you need to complete yourself:
 
1. Add developer information
2. Add SCM information
3. Add issue tracker information

The `pom.xml` already contains the comments with the necessary mark up. All you
have to do is add the information and remove the comments.


Building a Plug-in Jar

Run `mvn package` to create a plug-in jar which can be placed into the modules 
folder of a Metafacture distribution. After building the plug-in jar can be found 
in the `target` folder. The file is named `${artifactId}-VERSION-plugin.jar`.


Changing the Project License

The project is set-up with an Apache 2.0 license. If you want to use a different 
license, you have to make some modifications to the project set-up:

1. Update the license information in the pom.xml
2. Copy the license header which appears at the beginning of each file 
   into `quality_assurance/java-header.txt`
3. Modify the `ignoreLines` property of the Header module in 
   `quality_assurance/checkstyle_rules.xml` to exclude lines in your
   license header which may have varying content (such as names or dates)
4. Change the lines-attribute in `quality_assurance/checkstyle-suppressions.xml`
   to match the number of lines in `quality_assurance/java-header.txt`
